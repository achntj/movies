This film shows what indecisiveness really feels like. As an
ocassionally-indecisive person myself, this really hit home for me. Liz, in the
midst of a divorce and many important relationships, decides to travel across
Italy, India, and Bali - to find herself. She learns about cultures, makes new
connections, and does, infact, find herself.

In my books, this is a 10/10 for the story and the idea behind it all. Cannot
hate a self-discovery film. I came across this when I asked chat gpt to
recommend movies like "Zindagi Naa Milegi Dobaara" (a very very very good Indian
movie) and this was the answer. Did not disappoint for sure.

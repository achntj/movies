Another great rom com. Rom Coms are great. This one was fun for the most part,
sad for bits, and wholesome for a great part as well. A man hits his lowest,
finds a stranger friend, and they have fun. Eventually they both try to get
stable. That was oversimplified but it's a feel good that you MUST watch.

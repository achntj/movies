Definitely an underrated film regardless of it's popularity. Watching this might
change your understanding of love and relationships. It kinda questions the
idea of marriage - which is saying something. I didn't think it was one of those
fun rom-coms, it was much deeper and was an expression of ideas. Beautiful watch
with a lot to learn about finding love. Also, this movie deserves to be called
"Vicky Cristina Juan Maria" by every right. For how short this was, the
chemistry between characters was beyond well developed.

Definitely one of my favorite films ever. The music is on point, if you care. La
La Land is a breath of fresh air amidst all these movies that are too silly
sometimes. As some one who loves silly films (you'll find a lot on this site) I
appreciate La La Land for being realistic and mature. Certainly a top-tier film,
which, in my opinion, is better watched alone and given much thought when viewed.

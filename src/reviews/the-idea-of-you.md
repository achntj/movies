A very feel-good, fun, silly, unrealistic movie to watch. Don't get me wrong,
sometimes (all the time for me) you don't care about the story being realistic.
I really loved watching this. It's about a divorced middle-aged lady falling in
love with a 24 year old pop star - and their ups and downs. Anne Hathaway was
amazing as always and the story had me smiling the entire time. Definitely
something to watch with your friends / partners.

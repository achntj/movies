Loved this one. A relatively shorter movie with such a beautiful story - it
really captures the essence of feel-good movies. The pacing is brilliant, with
the narrator (also a recurring character) telling you what happens next,
but that only adds to the story and takes nothing away.

The story goes around two college students who are both in the midst of family
problems. They meet by chance (or 'fate' as the film emphasizes) and fall in
love while navigating these problems.

Overall, a very solid watch.

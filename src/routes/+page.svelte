    Alright, here's the deal: Iâ€™m not exactly a film person. However, in a fit
    of inspiration (or perhaps boredom), I decided to start watching more movies
    this summer. Naturally, instead of setting up a Letterboxd account, I went
    ahead and made an entire website to
    <s>learn the web framework 'Svelte'</s> document this grand cinematic
    journey.
    <br />
    I plan on adding reviews for some of my favorite movies without going into the
    story. That's what my idea of a "review" is upto some extent (?) - rather than
    sharing the story itself, I want this to be the "why / when / with whom to watch".
    <br />
    Lastly, there will be a lot of rom coms in this list.
